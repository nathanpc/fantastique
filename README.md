An unopinionated static website generator for PHP.

## Motivation

The motivation for building this static site generator was simple. PHP is one of
the most versatile ways of templating and quickly composing websites, but most
of the time we only need it for simple things that can be static.

This tiny module aims at creating a simple way to use PHP to create static
websites while maintaining the greatest amount of flexibility possible.
